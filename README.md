Gpt File Chrome Extensions

I developed this chrome extensions to allow for large files to be submitted to chatGPT for scanning, as chatGPT currently
has an input limit for characters. The script creates a button to be added to chatGPT page where when clicked opens up file dialogue. Extension also supports
drag and drop feature for files as well as progress bar which concurrently updates as file is being uploaded and scanned to chatGPT. In order to publish this chrome extension, permission is required from openAI, and I was not able to attain this permission. If you would like to try this extension out, you can download the folder and upload it to your own chrome developer dashboard using load unpacked at chrome://extensions/. This will allow you to enable the extension and use on your own device with chatGPT.
