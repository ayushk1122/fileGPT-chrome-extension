Gpt File Chrome Extensions

I developed this chrome extensions to allow for large files to be submitted to chatGPT for scanning, as chatGPT currently
has an input limit for characters. The script creates a button to be added to chatGPT page where when clicked opens up file dialogue. Extension also supports
drag and drop feature as well as progress bar which concurrently updates as file is being uploaded and scanned to chatGPT.
